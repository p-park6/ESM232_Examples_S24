# Dynamic Models

* 2 variable system of equations

* some addition complexity to illustrate
  * use of time series inputs
  * coupling models
  
# Competition Model


Species a (or Company a)

$\frac{\partial s_a}{\partial t} = r_{a} * s_a * (a-(\frac{s_a+\alpha_{ab} * s_b}{K_a}))$

Species b (or Company b)

$\frac{\partial s_b}{\partial t} = r_{b} * s_b * (a-(\frac{s_b+\alpha_{ba} * s_a}{K_b}))$

* $s_a, s_b$ are species populations
* $r_a, r_b$ are growth rates of each species
* $K_a, K_b$ are carrying capacities; could be the same for both species but maybe not?
* $\alpha_{ab}, \alpha_{ba}$ are competitive effect of the other species; could be the same for both species

# Implementation in R

Use the model to answer some interesting questions about competition

* growth rate 
* market/resource sharing
* intial conditions

How might you explore this?

# R code example
```{r implea}

source("../R/dcompetition.R")

dcompetition
# set up required parameters

pars = list(ra=0.15, rb=0.10, alphaab=0.2, alphaba=0.2, Ka=300, Kb=300)

# set up initial firm/population size
# con
initialsize = c(a=25, b=100)
months = seq(from=1, to=120)
res = ode(func=dcompetition, y=initialsize, times=months, parms=pars)

resl = as.data.frame(res) %>% pivot_longer(-time, names_to="Group", values_to="Gsize")

# notice how both converge to the carrying capacity
ggplot(resl, aes(time, Gsize, col=Group))+geom_line()

# what if there is total competition (e.g both share all potential resources), start from same place
initialsize = c(a=20, b=20)
pars = list(ra=0.15, rb=0.10, alphaab=1.0, alphaba=1.0, Ka=300, Kb=300)
res = ode(func=dcompetition, y=initialsize, times=months, parms=pars)

# faster growing group gets more of the market share
resl = as.data.frame(res) %>% pivot_longer(-time, names_to="Group", values_to="Gsize")
ggplot(resl, aes(time, Gsize, col=Group))+geom_line()

```

# Think about another strategy you might explore

* what would the ability for one group to find resources that the other couldn't look like?
* how do initial popultation influence results


# Adding some complexity

What if occasionally there are shocks to the system; 

* kind of like disturbance
* what if we were modeling this separately

How might you do this?

Two considerations

* event severity
* population vulnerability/sensitivity

# Time series of input event

* Generate time series of events (this could be from another model)

* Code the effects of the events on system in dynamic model
  * may require more parameters
  
* Use this time series as another input

# How to do with our framework

Lets say the disturbance event reduces the group size as follows

**Define**

* sensitivity factor (*sena*, *senb*)
  potentially different for each group;
* event occurence  (*shock*) time series
  * could just be 1/0 (binary) for event modeling
  * could use a value if you want to take into account severity
  
Reduction in group size is  $sena*shock[time]$

Start with just a binary shock - it happens or it doesn't (no severity)

# In R

Take advantage of time in differential equation

We can generate a sequence of events given a probability of an event
  * lets on average a 20% chance of occurring in a given month

Sample from a binomial distribution

We need a value for all the time steps we are simulating

```{r timeseries}

source("../R/dcompetition_shock.R")
dcompetition_shock

initialsize = c(a=20, b=20)
months = seq(from=1, to=120)

# create our disturbance
shock = rbinom(length(months), size=1, prob=0.2)
plot(months,shock)

# Set up our parameters include the shock time series
pars = list(ra=0.15, rb=0.10, alphaab=1.0, alphaba=1.0, Ka=300, Kb=300, sena=0.3, senb=0.1, shock=shock)
ressk = ode(func=dcompetition_shock, times=months, y=initialsize, parms=pars)

resskl = as.data.frame(ressk) %>% pivot_longer(-time, names_to="Group", values_to="Gsize")
ggplot(resskl, aes(time, Gsize, col=Group))+geom_line()
# what do you notice


ggplot(resskl, aes(time, Gsize, col=Group))+geom_line()+geom_line(data=resl, aes(time, Gsize, col=Group), linetype="dotted", lwd=2)
```

# Explore a bit more

* different sensitivities to disturbance
* disturbance severity (not just 0 or 1, maybe 1 for most severe, 0.5 for moderate)

```{r}

shock = sample(c(1,0.5,0), size=100, prob=c(0.01, 0.1, 0.89), replace=TRUE)
plot(shock)
```
