# Dynamic Models - Discrete 

Recall using in our diffusion model where we divided the world into "chunks"

This can be appropriate for...
* discrete population numbers (annual human populations)

Still an approximation because births/deaths happen all the time but "reasonable" to ignore

We can use "looping" rather than iteration

Makes it easy to do systems of equations 
  * tracking multiple variables
  
# Discrete Dynamic Example (age structured population)

* tracking multiple variables
  * numbers of individuals in each age group
  * note we are "discretizing" both time and age here
  
A system of equation that evolves the age struture (each age group) over time

* Sometimes called a population "matrix" model

# The basics

Suppose a population has individuals in different age
groups (lets say 4)

* Populations of individuals in each group: 
  * n0(t)
  * n1(t),
  * n2(t)
  * n3(t), where t is time

* Groups - lump all individuals in that age range (even
though in reality there will be a range of ages

* Dynamically model the evolution of that population

# Evolving

To evolve the population we also need to think about
births, deaths and aging

* births depend on fertility rates of the different
groups

* aging simply evolves one group to the next

* death remove individuals from a group

# Defining growth for overall population numbers

if b is birth rate and d is death rate

* n(t+1) = n(t) + (b-d) n(t)

* n(t+1) = (1+r) n(t) where r is an intrinsic rate of
increase (proportional/per capita rate of change)

* n(t+1) = *l* n(t) = where *l* is really the finite (geometric
growth rate)

# For multiple age classes we look survival probability

*  define a survival parameter $S_k$ that gives the fraction of
individuals that survive from age class k to age class k+1,

* for example n2(t + 1) = $S_1$ * n1(t).

* in this case, the time step/increment must be the same as
the increment between age classes!

* we often work with 1 year but could be 1 month (but age
classes would also be 1 month apart)

# Births



Births are little trickier because they may come from
multiple age classes, so define the

* parameter $F_j$ as the per capita fertility in age class j.
* The newly born all enter into age class 1, i.e.

* n1(t + 1) = $F_2$ * n2(t) + $F_3$ * n3(t)

* assume that population census is right after breeding
*  note that fertility is not fecundity (birth per capita but
includes survivability - live almost year to be included)

# Set up the Leslie Matrix

![](../img/leslie1.jpg)

# Use it with matrix multiplication to iterate

Could use nested *for* loops here but this is more efficient

  * outer loop for time
  * inner loop through each group


Matrix multiplication is often used for discrete system of equation dynamic models

# If you keep iterating

repeating above gets you to

![](../img/respop.jpg)


# Lets see in R

```{r setupleslie}
nclasses = 5

# create a growth matrix to store fertility and survivability information
gmatrix=matrix(nrow=nclasses, ncol=nclasses)
gmatrix

# change NAs to zero
gmatrix[]=0.0
gmatrix

# assign values for fertility for each of the age classes 
# notes that fertility rates are births per capita (number in class) per
# time step - time step here is decade - but could be hours
fert =  c(0,0.4,0.3,0.1,0.01)

# enter into our matrix
 gmatrix[1,]=fert
 
 # now add survivability 
 # survivability (to the next class) is also per time step
gmatrix[2,1]=0.5
gmatrix[3,2]=0.8
gmatrix[4,3]=0.2
gmatrix[5,4]=0.1

# we als want to to account for the oldest population group - they don't transfer to another group
# but they do die - this will be survivability per time step but they just stay in their class/group
gmatrix[5,5]=0.1

gmatrix

```

# Use Leslie matrix to  grow the population


```{r simplegrowth}

# start with an initial population, lets say 1 individual in each class

p0 = rep(1, times=nclasses)

# advance to the next time step
# note the use of matrix multiplication

p1 = gmatrix %*% p0
p1

# has the total number of individuals changed?




sum(p1)
sum(p0)

# growth rate
sum(p1)/sum(p0)

#add another year
p2 = gmatrix %*% p1

# combined
pop = cbind.data.frame(p0,p1,p2)
pop$age = c("0-1","1-10","11-20","21-50","50 and above")

popl = pop %>% pivot_longer(names_to="timestep",values_to="pop",-age)
ggplot(popl, aes(timestep, pop,fill=as.factor(age)))+geom_col(position="dodge")+labs(fill="Age Group")


# how might you change parameters to have the population grow?

```

# Multiple Time Steps

use a wrapper function to evolve a population through time

* inputs = survivability, fertility, initial population, time steps (all as vectors)
* output =  populations as a total by time and as broken down by age by time 
* a dynamic model - difference equations - similar to our diffusion model


Lets look at a bigger population - China

Break it in to decades,first decade of life (0 to 10 years old)
final decade greater than 90



 
```{r multitime}

# example evolve China pop
# fertility rates

F2 = 0.25/2
F3 = 0.5/2
F4 = 0.25/2
# assume all others also zero
# why divide by 2?

# survivability - based on mortality rates per thousand per decade
p12 = 1-79/1000 
p23 = 1-9.8/1000

decade = seq(from=1, to=ndecades)

ggplot(china_tot, aes(decade, poptot))+geom_col()+labs(y="Total Popultation")

```
 
#  Find parameters that mantain a stable population!
 
# Microbial Populations - Another example 
 
Lets try with a more complicated example - evolving an age structured population

Sensitivity **To**: fertility and survivability rates
  
Sensitivity **Of**: total population after 3 months
  
Assume we are looking at microbial population and monthly fertility and mortality rates; but format the same as china example

# Microbial Population Parameters

These microbes live for approximately 2 years
they are reproduce after 1 month of maturation

* 3 age groups
* 0-1 months old
* 1-2 months old
* more than 2 months

we can impact their survivability so we want to know how sensitive populations will be after 6 months if we do something to alter survivablity rates; 
but we also have uncertainty in what we know about reproduction rates


* 0-1 months - no fertility = survivability about 90%
* 1-2 months - population tends to double, survivability about 70%
* more 2 months - population fertility around 20%, suvivability only 30%


Try setting this up...
```{r  example}

source("../R/evolve_pop.R")


# set up best guess case
# survivability - based on mortality rates per thousand per decade
p12 = 0.9
p23 = 0.7
p34 = 0.2

F1= 0.0
F2 = 2.0
F3 = 0.3

# initial population parameters
ini = c(1000,1000, 1000)
nmonths = 12
fert_micro = c(F1,F2,F3)
surv_micro = c(p12,p23,p34)
micro_pop=evolve_pop(fert_micro, surv_micro, ini, nmonths)

# population after 12 months
micro_pop$poptot[12]
```

# Sensitivity Analysis for matrix populations

Now lets use Sobel sensitivity analysis to explore the how our intervention might impact the population...


AND account for uncertainty in some of our parameters

Reminder
Sobel sensitivity analysis breaks variance of output into 

* variance associated directly with parameter alone (fraction associated with each parameter, sum to 1)
* variance associated with parameter and interaction with other parameters (sum can be more than 1)

# Steps

* run sobel to get parameter sets in a sensitivity analysis object
* run model with those parameter sets
* tell the senstivity object about results associated with each parameter set
* look at sensitivity analysis metric from sobel

```{r sobel}
